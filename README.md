# HTTPMethodGrabber
Get allowed methods on web server 



Small lightweight program that help web developers and security researchers to test
 certain web server for Allowed HTTP methods  to determine weakness .

This program sends an http request with options method and
 check response headers , specially  'allow' header  which stands for
 the mentioned weakness it displays its value and determine if the server is 
vulnerable or not  , also it display all other headers and HTTP Response body

Note :404 response could not be checked as .NET throughs an exception on 404 and 
can not receive response headers  so can not check for UI Redressing
